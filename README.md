I am Aditya Prasad. I am from the old and diverse city of [New Delhi, India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi).  
Every once in a while, I think of something that feels worth writing down, however, I never do. I'd like to change that. Hopefully it'll be useful for future me and anyone else who stumbles upon this website.

## POST THOUGHT 1
### Mindset During Learning: Different Iterations
#### Dated: Friday, 18 June 2021


This summer, I am working on machine learning problems and as a result I have had to reacquaint myself with 
the literature. I say reacquaint because I have worked on it before. Like several others at my college, I too
fell for the hype in the beginning of my sophomore year which led me down a few rabbit holes before the interest 
eventually vanished.

I find myself working in the same field again and this time is different. I wouldn't exactly say that I am wiser so I understand things better, thats not it. I do struggle with some of the same concepts and it takes a little while before I develop intuition. I say that because I have a better appreciation of the problem at hand. And, its not the cutting edge nature of the problem that I am talking about here. I am talking about the canonical problems that everyone is introduced to when they start learning the subject (this probably applies to other subjects as well). For machine learning or deep learning, its the MNIST hand-written dataset classification problem, or the flower classification problem. Previously, I shrugged them as 'too basic, give me something more complex so I can change the world', now I realize that sometimes its the simplest of problems that one should spend considerable amount of their time on before they move on to more complex ones. The shift in attitude does seem to play a part here. I'd share some of the learning from working on these simpler problems in future post(s). Howerver, for this one, I have another experience to share. 

I realized that my thinking, while I am going over the same material, something I like to call as live-thinking is also very different to the last time. Previously, most of my effort would go into thinking mostly of the end product, or on the qualities of the end product. Now, its mostly about trying to intuit/piece-together the inner machinery of the process by learning more and more and tweaking more and more. I guess as an engineer, that's my primary goal anyway. To me, its a paradigm shift in thinking. Plus, there is an added benefit to realizing this. Now I know if I have to teach the same material to someone, I can pick their thought process much better. I know what its like in the beginning to struggle and be in a state of confusion, where the concepts just don't seem to gel together. Personally (and I guess this is common for others too), the problem isn't that I don't know indivdual discrete concepts well, I just don't know how they connect with each other. As a result I have difficulty zooming out of one area of the conceptual landscape and zooming into the another. This becomes a challenge and if we couple that with super high expectations like I did the first time round, one can easily loose interest. 

I thought, this was an interesting finding. 

**PS**: I will try to make it a point to finish every post with a music recommendation where the title matches a phrase from somewhere in the post. Bonus points if the meanings happen to sync as well! Here it is: [Paradigm Shift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vi2IQNs8hlE) by Liquid Tension Experiment.
